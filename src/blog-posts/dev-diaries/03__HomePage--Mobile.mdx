# 03\_\_HomePage--Mobile

Heya!

Today's blog is less about technical stuff and more about structure and design. Today...We start actually working on our site's layout! (Also yes I tend to use [BEM](https://getbem.com/) as my naming convention for these entries idk it's a comfort thing)

<img
  src="/dev_diaries/03_homepage_mobile/01_mobile_layout.jpg"
  style={{ maxWidth: "100%", alignSelf: "center" }}
/>

## Justification

As you can tell, I'm NOT a designer. But overall I think it tells the basic story I want! (Also yes this isn't the actual way to use 60/30/10 I'm not selling a product and thus don't need a CTA with the 10% so we get kirby background) I'm doing Mobile-first design, which is what tailwind wants done by default, and I'm nothing if not a surrenderer to the narrative (also it's generally easier to modularly **add** complexity than it is to remove it via media queries). That being said, When it comes to design, I have to maske a desktop version first (Which exists, but i'll post that file on a separate post) cause I otherwise can't get a vision of what I want the site to look like.

Basically,

### Design

> Desktop => Mobile

### Coding

> Mobile => Desktop

Now that we have that out of the way, this is once again a show of how React makes our code a lot easier to look at:

```jsx
export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main
      className=" flex-col items-center flex bg-slate-400 min-h-[100vh] 
                  bg-home-page bg-no-repeat bg-cover gap-4"
    >
      <Navbar />
      <Preamble />
      <ButtonContainer />
      <ChatBox />
      <Footer />
    </main>
  );
}
```

Here we can see each section encapsulated in one Component, which is pretty sweet ngl! Currently, all we have codewise in each componen is boilerplate:

```jsx
const Footer = () => {
  return <footer>Footer</footer>;
};

export default Footer;
```

But now this means that we can see that each component gets rendered as expected on our website itself:

<img
  src="/dev_diaries/03_homepage_mobile/02_mobile_boilerplate.jpg"
  style={{ maxWidth: "100%", alignSelf: "center" }}
/>

## Feature Implementation

So now, we can very easily work on each component independently, and make sure that our setup works perfectly on mobile. We can also work on the macro layout but I'll work on that later. WIP!
