    Ok so this one's gonna be crazy. I want to have a playlist builder, but that's the last feature for sure since i want to use rust for that.
    
    I need to consume spotify api probably, since i want some artist info etc. I want to get album artwork,  etc for each individual "review" That i'll do.

    However, on the main music page, i want a...personal analyhsis running. (One that shows the type of songs i've been listening too divided by genre, mood, geolocation etc.) 

    If possible it'd also be cool if a playlist gets generated based on my top 20 songs at build time.
    */

    /* 
        For the individual posts, i want it to be pretty visually striking with a background and accent colour determined by the album artwork's colour. Some sort of color extraction'll be needed.

        Aldo i want to have reviewCards be pretty as h4ell, probably have the Album artwork be the hero image.
